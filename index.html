    <p>Myself Saransh Kalsi , I am 25 years old. Since 2015 , I have been trying to be a great web developer and get into IT field but always lacked motivation. </p>

    <br>
        
     <p>I consider myself as a really creative person but I never reached my full potential due to being lazy majority of time. However, I consider that knowing what you lack in yourself can help you get further in life. After completing my Diploma from Algonquin College I plan to run SASS (Software as a service company) along with my brother. </p>

     <br>
    
    <p> Being in this program helped me alot in generating awareness about all the amazing things I can do with the skills I am learning so far. Recently, I have decided to re create logos of some companies in order to hone my skills. I am looking forward to working in a projects for my web development course with my peer groups.</p>
